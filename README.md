# [Unofficial Raycast Wiki](https://github.com/SKaplanOfficial/unofficial-raycast-wiki/wiki)

The unofficial, community-contributed guide to [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) for macOS.

The purpose of this repository is to extend Raycast's [existing documentation](https://manual.raycast.com), providing more detailed and specific information that may not be suitable for inclusion in the main Raycast documentation.

The bulk of the guide's content is in the [wiki](https://github.com/SKaplanOfficial/unofficial-raycast-wiki/wiki), which serves as the primary repository for the documentation. The subdirectories of this repository contain additional examples and resources.
